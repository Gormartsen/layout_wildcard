## Layout Wildcard

This module adds a new `Alternative paths` setting to each layout configuration. This setting allows specifying a list of multiple additional paths to be handled by the layout.

Additional features:

- Allows specifying a path in the form of `somepath/%` that will apply to all subpaths.
- ([planned](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/layout_wildcard/issues/1)) Supports specifying URL aliases instead of system paths.
